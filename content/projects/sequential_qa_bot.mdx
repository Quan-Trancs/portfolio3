Created a RAG architecture system to store and retrieve restaurant information, enabling intelligent routing between vector store knowledge bases and web search.

Integrated multi-agent sequential workflow using LangChain with conditional routing, LLM nodes, and hallucination detection.

## Key Features

**RAG Architecture**
- Vector store for restaurant information
- Embedding generation and similarity search
- Knowledge base retrieval
- Web search integration for real-time data

**Intelligent Routing**
- Multi-agent sequential workflow
- Conditional routing between knowledge bases
- LLM nodes for decision making
- Hallucination detection and prevention

## Technical Highlights

Built with Python using LangChain framework for agent orchestration. Utilizes vector stores for semantic search and embeddings for knowledge representation. Implements retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern combining vector databases with web search for accurate and up-to-date restaurant information retrieval.
