A chess game implementation featuring an AI opponent that uses the min-max algorithm for intelligent move selection. The project demonstrates advanced algorithm design principles, game tree traversal, and decision-making strategies in a classic board game context. Built using Prolog, showcasing declarative programming approaches to game logic.

## Key Features

**AI Implementation**
- Min-Max algorithm for optimal move selection
- Alpha-Beta pruning for efficiency
- Evaluation function for board position assessment
- Configurable search depth

**Game Logic**
- Complete chess rules implementation
- Move validation and legal move generation
- Check and checkmate detection
- Board state representation

## Technical Highlights

Developed using SWI-Prolog, a robust Prolog implementation. Utilizes declarative programming paradigms to represent chess rules and game logic. Implements min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning optimization to reduce computational complexity while maintaining optimal decision-making.
