CollabBoard is a collaborative online whiteboard tool designed for brainstorming, real-time collaboration, and visual organization. It enables teams, educators, and individuals to ideate, plan, and organize their workflows effectively. This project deepened my experience in building real-time web applications and designing user-friendly interactive interfaces.
