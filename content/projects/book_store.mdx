Developed a production-ready API supporting 1,000+ concurrent users with 98% uptime using Dockerized microservices. Reduced API response times by 70% through strategic indexing, Redis/Caffeine caching, and asynchronous processing. Architected security featuring JWT authentication, rate limiting, and secure data validation pipelines.
